# Java_1_Latin-Squares

A Latin Square is a n x n matrix. Each cell of the matrix is an element taken from a given set of symbols (for example, a subset of the Latin alphabet).

The constraints are:

In each row, all elements are different.
In each column, all elements are different.

It takes 0, 2 or 3 command line arguments: 
For no arguments a sample square will be shown
For two arguments the first one will be the natural number n and the second will be aither "latin" or "greek" to decide which character set will be used.
A third argument can be added to specify how many of the possible squares will be shown.

The implementation uses the Choco API for Constraint Satisfaction Problems.
